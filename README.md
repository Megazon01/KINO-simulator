# KINO SIMULATOR

This is a program that runs multiple KINO simulations while keeping track of user profits!

## Rules a KINO game:

- The player selects anywhere between 1 and 12 numbers ranging from 1 to 80 and places a bet
- 20 numbers are randomly drawn out of the available 80
- Depending on how many numbers the player selected and the number of correct guesses, the payout is determined

At the start of the game the user can input the number of simulations over which the program can run. For simplicity, the program maintains the same betting amount throughout all simulations.
At the end of the process, the program returns the net profit/loss of the player given their strategy over the selected number of simulations.

Note: This is a program made to simulate a real game provided by the Greek betting agency OPAP. For this reason, the payouts for each result
are already given on the company's website and are not determined by me.
The purpose of this game is to allow the user to experiment with different strategies in order to get a sense of the expected outcomes.
