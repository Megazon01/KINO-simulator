This is a program that runs KINO simulations over
several tries for a selected strategy. The rules of the game are:


The player selects anywhere between 1 and 12 numbers ranging from 1 to 80

20 numbers are randomly drawn out of the available 80

Depending on the player's strategy and number of correct guesses, the payout is determined.

At the start of the game the user can input the number of simulations over which the program can run.
At the end of the process,the program returns the net profit/loss of the player given their strategy over the selected number of simulations.

Note: This is a game made to simulate a real game provided by a betting agency in Cyprus called OPAP. For this reason, the payouts for each 
are already given on the company's website and are not determined by me.
The purpose of this game is to allow the user to experiment with different strategies in order to get a sense of the expected outcomes.
